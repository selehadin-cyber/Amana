        <p className="text-center">A group of Amana philanthropists, alarmed by the rising number of children orphaned by wars and conflicts in neighboring countries,
         came together to form a community initiative called “The Committee of Amana for 
         Orphan Sponsorship”. Eight years later, an international NGO was set up under the 
         name “Amana Association” to scale up the initiative, broaden its range of activities and
          augment its outreach, </p>
          <p>Almost four decades later, Amana Association has grown to become one of the largest humanitarian and development organizations in the world, providing life-saving assistance to those hit by conflicts, persecution and natural disasters and creating durable solutions for poverty using sustainable development programs in social welfare, water and sanitation, education, nutrition and economic empowerment. </p>
